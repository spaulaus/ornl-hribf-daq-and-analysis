SEC$.010  Introduction
BLP$
TXX manipulates alphameric material
to form centered and side headings, single lines,
and left and right justified paragraphs of four styles.
Pages may be specified to be any length and any width up to 75 characters.
The input is typed starting in col.
1 and ending in any column up to 80.
No word should be broken (continued from one line to the next)
in the input text.
Text formating is specified by the use of a number of
\u\case\\ \u\insensitive\\ directives. 
The first line processed by TXX must contain a directive
as must the last line.
Only the first 4 characters of a directive line (i. e. the directive itself)
is processed unless stated otherwise in the following list. The following
directives are recognized:
