CHP$Adding Experimental Shapes to DAMM

Things to do
ODP$
(1)....Define a file structure to contain the peak shapes.
I would use the \b\spk-file\\ structure. You can record the
relavant parameters (peak position, width, etc) in header words
18 thru 22.  See \b\SPKIO & SPKMAN\\ documentation in sections
in the \b\ORPHLIB or MILIB\\ sections of the handbook for management
of such files.
ODP$
(2)....Each entry should contain: a peak position,
a peak width, an ID number, and an array defining the peak
shape. It will be convenient if all shapes are normalized
to some fixed area.
ODP$
(3)....Write routines to support the storage and retrival
of entries to/from this file.
ODP$
(4)....Add a command to routine \b\SAMRU\\ to open and read
the shape file. See lines 105 and 155 of \b\SAMRU\\ for suggested 
programming. You have to write routine \b\"SHAPRED"\\.
ODP$
(5)....Use the \b\PK command\\ to specify the desired shape
IDs. Process one additional field 
such that the format is:
CYB$
       PK  XP WIDTH  0  0  ID
FIP$
Note: the 0 fields are required as place keepers. See line 26
of routine \b\PEAKADD\\ for suggested programming.
FIP$
At fitting time: KFUN(NPK) is set equal to LAT(J,5). I.E. the 
shape ID gets saved into KFUN. This is already done - you don't
have to do anything.
FIP$
Finally \b\KFUN(I)+1\\ gets passed to \b\SFUNK\\ which generates the
components for the fit (currently gaussians, asymmetric 
gaussians, etc) as IGO. Now, IGO is not currently being used so you
can use IGO-1 as the shape ID. That is, IF(IGO-1.GT.0) call a routine
to retrive the experimental shape by ID and transform it such that the
peak position is located at \b\PAR(1)\\ and the "width" is as specified
by \b\PAR(2)\\. See line 4 of \b\SFUNK\\ for suggested programming.
You have to write routine \b\"SHAPFUN"\\.
ODP$
(6)....If you do this, all of the non-linear search should work
without change.
ODP$
(7)....Modify \b\FITUM\\
to detect if
the peak is an experimental shape by testing \b\KFUN(I)\\ and
if it is, calculate the peak area using the corresponding
\b\BETA\\. If all shapes were pre-normalized to a fixed area, then 
this fixed area and \b\BETA\\ is all you need to know to calculate the
"best fit" area. See line 519 of \b\FITUM\\ for suggested programming.

BLP$
An alternate method for entering peaks, for which experimental shapes are
to be used, is via the cursor mode.
Here you would have to
enter a 1-key command and then be prompted for the
shape-ID to be used. The width recorded for the peak would be the "standard"
one in this case. See handwritten notes at lines 28, 79 and 112 of routine
CUSS (in module xsam.f) for suggested programming.
