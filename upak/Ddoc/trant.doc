CHP$Beam-Particle Transit-Time - TRANT
TPF$
BLP$
TRANT is a simple program which calculates transit-times and changes
in transit-time due small changes in beam energy for a system of
drift and acceleration regions such as found in a tandem accelerator.
The input data for TRANT consists of two parts: The first defines the
geometry of the system and the second specifies ions and energies
for which calculations are to be done.
CYB$
Geometry Data ----------------------------------------------------
BLP$
The geometry is specified by up to 100 fixed-format entries of the
following form:
CY1$
0000000001111111111222222222233333 ---- Col. Number
1234567890123456789012345678901234
LABEL       KIND ISTR FLG XM
ODP$
LABEL..is any label that you desire up to 8 characters in length.
ODP$
KIND...can take on one of the following names: DRIF denotes a drift
region, IACC denotes an injector acceleration region, TACC denotes
a tandem acceleration region.
ODP$
ISTR...can take on one of the following names: PRES denotes pre-strip
region and POSS denotes post-strip region.
ODP$
FLG....is usually blank but if non-blank causes program to insert
a line of **** preceding specified region.
ODP$
XM.....is the length of the region in meters.
ODP$
END....entered in the "label field" terminates the "geometry data".
CYB$
Ion Specification Data -------------------------------------------
BLP$
The remaining data are entered free-form. The first two entries defined
should really be computed by the program or belong in the Geometry
section but that's not how it is.
CY1$
TANL = X   ;Specify active acceleration length X(meters) for tandem
INJL = X   ;Specify active acceleration length X(meters) for injector
E0   = X   ;Specify ion energy X(MeV) after extraction
           ;That is a zero following the E not an OH
VINJ = X   ;Specify injector voltage X(MV)
VTAN = X   ;Specify tandem terminal voltage X(MV)
AMU  = X   ;Specify ion mass X(amu)
Q    = X   ;Specify post stripper charge state X
GO         ;Says do the calculation
BLP$
Only those quantities which are to be changed need to be entered
for sucessive calculations "GOs".

Definition of Output Quantities ----------------------------------
BLP$
The quantities AMU, E0, VINJ, VTAN & Q are printed at the top of the
page. The columns labeled REGION, ---TYPE---, and XL(M) reproduce the
geometry input data. The remaining columns are defined as follows:
RND$09
ODP$
E(MeV)...gives the beam energy (in MeV) at the entrance (beginning) to
the region specified.
ODP$
T(NS)....is the transit-time (in nanoseconds) to the beginning of the
region being defined.
ODP$
KV/NS....is the number of keV that the energy of a beam particle must
be changed in order that the arrival time at the "target" (end of the
last region specified) is shifted by 1 nanosecond. This is the useful
quantity.
ODP$
DKV4.....is just 4 times KV/NS.
ODP$
DKV125...is just 125 times KV/NS.
ODP$
DKV4/Q...is just DKV4 divided by Q.
