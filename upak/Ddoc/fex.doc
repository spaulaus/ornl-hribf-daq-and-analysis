File Examination Utility
BLP$
FEX was written to make it easier for me to examine output
from program PAC (written onto POB-files). Essentially, it
allows you to display (or log) any range of 16- or 32-bit
words on the file in various formats. Arbitrary ASCII lines 
may also be displayed or logged. Assuming that the path to the \b\fex\\
executable has been apprpriately defined:

Type:  fex        ;To get started

The following commands are supported:

Commands for general setup ................................................
CY1$
RECL N    - Record length in bytes for subsequent OPEN - \b\See NOTE-1\\
            (not normally needed - default = 512 bytes)

In  file  - Specify input file

LON       - Turn command logging to fex.log ON          
LOF       - Turn command logging to fex.log OFF (dflt)  

CMD file  - Process commands from file.cmd              
WO        - Wait for typed [RETURN] to continue         
  
HOFF N    - Specify 16-bit word offset on input file (default = 0)
FOFF N    - Specify 32-bit word offset on input file (default = 0)
          - (Display & Log ranges are relative to offset)
          - (does not apply to DL and PL commands)
                                                        
END       - Ends program 
CYB$
Byte swapping commands .....................................................
CY1$
CVIF SWAF - Says do full-word byte-swap of input file (in place)

CVIF SWAB - Says do half-word byte-swap of input file (in place)

NOTE:     - The file length should be an integer multiple of RECL
            for this procedure to work to completion.
CYB$ 
Masking commands ...........................................................
CY1$
MSKF MSK  - Says do a full-word masking of input file (in place)
          - MSK is entered in hexadecimal

NOTE:     - The file length should be an integer multiple of RECL
            for this procedure to work to completion.

Symbols and loops ..........................................................
CY1$
Commands related to LOOP execution and SYMBOL definition

SYM = EXPRESSION - Define symbol (SYM) up to 100 symbols supported
                 - symbols M, N, O, P, Q, R, S are reserved
                 - expression syntax is same as in CHIL
                 - no imbedded blanks are allowed in expressions
                 - symbols may contain up to 4 characters (5-8 ignored)

DSYM             - Displays list of currently defined sumbols & values

LOOP N           - Starts LOOP (executed N-times) N=SYM or CONST
CMD  ....        - Nesting supported
CMD  ....        - # lines between 1st LOOP & matching ENDL = 100
ENDL             - Defines end-of-loop
                 - KILL (entered before ENDL) kills LOOP
                 - Ctrl/C - aborts loop-in-progress
                 - opening of CMD-file within a LOOP not allowed

\bu\NOTE-1\\ Files are opened for direct access (except for DL and PL 
commands) with fixed record length = RECL. 
This means that you may get an error when trying to display or
log words from a short file or near the end of any file whose length
is not a multiple RECL bytes. In these cases RECL may need to be 
adjusted.
