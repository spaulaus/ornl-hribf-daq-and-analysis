BLP$
This subroutine determines the parameters necessary to                    
compute a smoothing spline under tension. For a given                     
increasing sequence of abscissae (X(I)),I=1,N) and                 
associated ordinates (Y(I)),I=1,N) the function                   
determined minimizes the summation from (I=1,N-1) of                   
the square of the second derivative of F plus SIGMA
squared times the difference of the first derivative of F                 
and (F(X(I+1))-F(X(I)))/(X(I+1)-X(I)) squared, over all                   
functions F with two continuous derivatives such that the                 
summation of the square of (F(X(I))-Y(I))/D(I) is less                    
than or equal to a given constant S, where (D(I)),I=1,N)
are a given set of observation weights. The                        
function determined is a spline under tension with third                  
derivative discontinuities at (X(I)),I=2,N-1). for                 
actual computation of points on the curve it is necessary                 
to call the function CURV2. The determination of the curve                
is performed by subroutine CURVSS, the subroutine CURVS                  
only decomposes the workspace for CURVSS.

ODP$
N......is the number of values to be smoothed (N.GE.2).                  
ODP$
X......is an array of the N increasing abscissae of the                  
values to be smoothed.                                                    
ODP$
Y......is an array of the N ordinates of the values to be                
smoothed, (i.e. Y(K) is the functional value                             
corresponding to X(K) ).                                                  
ODP$
D......is a parameter containing the observation weights.                
This may either be an array of length N or a scalar                       
(interpreted as a constant). The value of D                               
corresponding to the observation (X(K),Y(K)) should                       
be an approximation to the standard deviation of error.                   
ODP$
ISW....contains a switch indicating whether the parameter                
D is to be considered a vector or a scalar,                               
CY1$
       ISW = 0 if D is an array of length N,                                 
       ISW = 1 if D is a scalar.                                             
ODP$
S......contains the value controlling the smoothing. This                
must be non-negative. For S equal to zero, the                            
subroutine does interpolation, larger values lead to                      
smoother funtions. If parameter D contains standard                       
deviation estimates, a reasonable value for S is                          
FLOAT(N).

ODP$
EPS....contains a tolerance on the relative precision to                 
which S is to be interpreted. This must be greater than                   
or equal to zero and less than or equal to one. A
reasonable value for EPS is SQRT(2.0/FLOAT(N)).                            
ODP$
YS.....is an array of length at least N.                                 
ODP$
YSP....is an array of length at least N.                                 
ODP$
SIGMA..contains the tension factor. This value indicates                 
the degree to which the first derivative part of the                      
smoothing functional is emphasized. If SIGMA is nearly                    
zero (e.g. .001) the resulting curve is approximately a                  
cubic spline. If SIGMA is large (e.g. 50.) the                           
resulting curve is nearly a polygonal line. If SIGMA                     
equals zero a cubic spline results. A standard value for                  
SIGMA is approximately 1.
ODP$
TEMP...is an array of length at least 9*N which is used                  
for scratch storage.

smoothed curve at the given nodes.
