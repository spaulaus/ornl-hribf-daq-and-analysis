\bu\To Create a DVD or CD\\

Insert a DVD or CD into the DVD drive (bottom - labeled)

Follow steps 1 through 5 of the \b\next section\\


\bu\To use the DVD or CD in program scanor\\

Insert the DVD or CD in the DVD drive (bottom - labeled)
or
Insert the CD in the CD drive         (top  - unlabeled)
and Type: 

\b\mount /dev/cdrom0\\              ;If using CD  drive (unlabeled - top)

\b\mount /dev/cdrom1\\              ;If using DVD drive (labeled - bottom)


\bu\To open a file in  program scanor, Type:\\

\b\file /mnt/cdrom0/filename.ldf\\  ;if using CD  drive (top)

\b\file /mnt/cdrom1/filename.ldf\\  ;if using DVD drive (bottom)

\b\Note:\\ You cannot "punch out" a disk without dismounting it.
\b\Note:\\ A mounted DVD or CD is readable by all.
===========================================================================
    \b\WARNING - FOUR WAYS YOU CAN SCREW THINGS OP WITHOUT REALLY TRYING!!\\
BLP$
(1) Execute a creation process using the \b\Gnome\\ window manager 
without disabling the \b\magicdev\\ tool. It will hang the system at the
end of writing the DVD and you will need to get a \b\root person\\ to fix it.
BLP$
(2) Kill the creation process before it is finished and you will need a
\b\root person\\ to un-hang the DVD writing system.
BLP$
(3) Log off without dismounting the DVD or CD and nobody else but you or a
\b\root person\\ can dismount it.
BLP$
(4) Tell the system that you are going to create a DVD but insert CD media
into the drive. It may run out of space and hang the system.

SEC$.020  Creation of DVDs & CDs for Data Processing - Details
BLP$
We presume that you have written your data to an \b\LDF\\ format event file
on disk, and now you need to preserve it in a permanent form. We use
DVD for long-term storage of event data.
CY1$
\bu\A recording process consists of the following steps in order:\\
  
\bu\(1) Start the application\\
BLP$
The application is started by calling: \b\/usr/local/bin/DvdIoHandler\\ which
brings up the graphical user interface to the DVD recording software.
CY1$
\bu\(2) Create a container file system to temporally hold files to be stored\\
BLP$
A screen will present itself.  You can select to create a CD or a DVD,
either will be written with the UDF file format. The choice here
determines the size of the container file system created and thus how
much data you can write to the CD or DVD. Once you made you selection,
press the \b\Create\\ button to create the container file system. The
programm cannot be terminated during the time the container file
system is created, hence the \b\Exit\\ button will become unavailable.
BLP$
While the container file system is created, you can monitor the
process in the progress bar in the bottom of the window. Once the
container file system is created, a new window will appear that allows
you to select files.
CY1$
\bu\(3) Add files - create a list of files to be copied to container file\\ 
BLP$
You may select files that you want to record on DVD or CD. In this
step the files are not actually copied, they are just collected. You
may add files or directories using the \b\Add\\ button in the screen
presented.  The files and directories will be displayed in tree
form.  The available space will be listed in the progress bar at the
bottom of the screen. You may also delete previously selected files.
BLP$
In order to add new files or directories press the \b\Add\\ button, which
will present you with a screen to select.  Select the radio button
labeled \b\Directory\\ if you want to add an entire directory. Press \b\OK\\
when you have made your selection from this window.
CY1$
\bu\(4) Copy files to the container file\\
BLP$
Once you selected all the files you want to record on the DVD or the
CD, you may press either the \b\Copy, Copy&Record\\ or the 
\b\Copy&Record&Exit\\
button. This will start the copying process.  Depending on where your
orignal files reside and how much data you are copying, this may take
a while. The progress bar at the bottom of the screen let's you know
how many data have been copied.
CY1$
\bu\(5) Record files to DVD or CD - copy from container file to DVD or CD\\
BLP$
Once all files are copied, the recording process can be started by
pressing the \b\Record\\ button. However, after the \b\Record\\ button is 
pressed, the
\b\Exit\\ button will become unavailable since terminating the program at
the recording stage will make the recorded DVD useless. \b\Please to not
kill the program during the recording stage!\\

BLP$
If a recording error occurs, you are informed by a pop-up window.  The
error may be due to missing recording media or other problems with the
DVD Writer itself. Please make sure that the DVD Writer contains a
writable DVD or CD disk and try to record again.
BLP$
If you selected the \b\Copy&Record\\ or the \b\Copy&Record&Exit\\ button and
a record error occurs, you will be given the opportunity to press the
\b\Record\\ button after the DVD Writer problem was resolved. The program
will NOT exit. 
CYB$
Recording will take about 30min. 
BLP$
It is easiest to use the GUI \b\/usr/local/bin/DvdIoHandler\\ to write the
DVD.  Several steps may be combined, once the container file system
has been created and the desired data has been selected. After these
tasks are completed you have to option to copy and record in one
step. These two tasks are the most time intensive, since it may take
to actually copy the data from their current location into the
container file system. In addition, recording a DVD or CD will take
about 30min. If you plan to leave, select the \b\Copy&Record&Exit\\
button, which will copy the data, record them and exit the program.
BLP$
Please make sure to exit the program after you finish recording the
DVD or CD. This will clean up resources you use while copying and
recording.
BLP$
Once you started the DVD recording process, you are the only person
that can record data to the DVD Writer. You may have up to three
processes simulataneously, however, only one process can record
data. If you use the \b\Copy&Record&Exit\\ or the 
\b\Copy&Record\\ you will be
automatically limited to one concurrent process.
CYB$
Limitations and problems we have noted
RND$05
ODP$
(1)..The software we are using to make the UDF file system seems to crash
the system under Linux kernels greater than \b\2.4.20-18.9.\\  The
problem occurs while copying the data to the container filesystem.
ODP$
(2)..We have observed that if you use the \b\Gnome\\ window manager, it will
hang the system at the end of writing the DVD.  The solutions are:  
RND$07
CY1$  
     (a) Switch to \b\KDE\\ or a lightweight window manager (e.g. \b\TWM\\)

     (b) Disable the \b\magicdev\\ tool which runs under \b\Gnome\\.

SEC$.030  Use of DVDs & CDs for Data Processing - Details
BLP$
The files stored on the disk have the same format and encodings as on
the original disk.  Please note that the data are BINARY, and that the
Intel machines on which we take data are \b\little-endian\\.  If you read
the disks on a \b\big-endian\\ machine, it may be necessary to swap the
bytes, especially in histogram files.  Event files  will be swapped
automatically by \b\SCANOR\\, at some loss of efficiency.  If you  need to
byte-swap use the program \b\/usr/hhirf/swapo\\. 
SEC$.032  Macintosh and Windows computers
BLP$
Using the DVD is as easy as inserting it into your DVD drive and
waiting for the system to mount it. You can then copy the files about as
you wish. 
SEC$.034  Linux computers
BLP$
On Linux, ordinary users  logged in at the console can arrange to mount
CD and DVD devices. Some window managers, e.g. \b\Gnome\\ and \b\KDE\\, under
Linux will try to mount the  DVD for you, then popup a file manager
window.  Then you can manipulate the files as you wish. 
BLP$
Failing that, your system should be setup to permit you to mount the
DVD. If your \b\/etc/fstab\\ file has a line like: 
CYB$
/dev/cdrom1     /mnt/cdrom1      udf,iso9660 noauto,owner,kudzu,r o 0 0  
CY1$
Then you can mount the DVD by using a command like:

\b\mount /dev/cdrom1\\ 
BLP$
It seems that the default will be to mount the DVD as  \b\/mnt/cdrom1\\ 
which can be treated like an ordinary disk. 
To dismount the disk, use one of the following commands:
CY1$
\b\umount /dev/cdrom1\\, or   

\b\eject /dev/cdrom1\\ 

SEC$.036  Other UNIX computers
BLP$
Our experience with other UNIX systems, especially older ones, 
is that  only the \b\root\\
user can mount DVD's.  
Thus you would have to arrange with the sys admin to get root access,
or copy all your data at once to local storage.
The commands for mounting a CD or DVD vary substantially from UNIX
version to UNIX version, so please consult a local expert.
