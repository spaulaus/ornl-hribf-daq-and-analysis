This version of UPAK contains support for CYGWIN, MACOS X, 64-bit OS's.
This support is arranged by modifying the Makefile at the top 
of the directory tree.  CYGWIN and MAC OS X differences are inserted 
where necessary using #ifdef statements in the Fortran and C source
code.  Where the Fortran has these statements, the files are named
xxx.F, using the capital 'F', which the GNU compilers interpret to
run through the C-preprocessor. 


It also has a new memory-mapped I/O routine for histogramming, 
replacing the shared-memory system for histograms.  This means 
you no longer need to reconfigure your kernel to have access 
to histograms while you scan.  The support is automatic.
