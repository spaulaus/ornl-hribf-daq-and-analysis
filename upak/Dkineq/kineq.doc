KINEMATICS AND Q-VALUES - PROGRAM KINEQ
BLP$
KINEQ calculates kinematic quantities either relativistically or classically as
a function of either lab energy of the projectile or lab angle of the
outgoing particle.
Q-values only may also be calculated.
The different modes of operation are selected by means of "commands"
(input one per line - starting in col-1).
Use whatever commands are required to "set up" the desired
"conditions" and then type "GO" to actually do it.
CYB$
All commands and element names may be typed in upper or lower case.

How to Write the Reaction - Other Comments
BLP$
The reaction is written in the usual way, however
no imbedded blanks are allowed and at least one blank must follow the
reaction field.
For example, 12C(16O,4HE)24MG or C12(16O,HE4)MG24 are both acceptable.
All particles except N (for neutron) must contain the mass number.
The proton, deuteron, and triton are denoted by 1H, 2H, and 3H or by
H1, H2, and H3.
The reaction is decoded and "exact" nuclear masses are found by using
recommended masses from 
"The 1995 Update to the Atomic Mass Evaluation"  by G. Audi and 
A. H. Wapstra,
Nuclear Physics, Vol. A595 Vol 4, p.409-480, December 25, 1995
or a set of mass formula coefficients due to G. T. Garvy
et al, Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 41, No. 4, Part II (1969) Page S1.
If the mass formula is involved the Q-value is flaged with ***.
BLP$
If only Q-values are to be calculated, there may be up to 7 outgoing particles
or only a residual particle.
Multiple outgoing particles
must be written as a string of single particles seperated by commas.
For example two alphas would be written as 4HE,4HE not 2HE4.
The maximum reaction length is 40 characters.
CYB$
Example:   - Note: it types the ">" - you don't.

Definition of The Calculated Quantities
BLP$
The meaning of most of the calculated quantities should be clear from
the labels.
The relativistic kinematic routine calculates both solutions in those cases
where there are two.
The two solutions are labeled 1 and 2.
ODP$
E(MEV)...denotes the lab energy of the projectile.
ODP$
THLB-O,THCM-O...denote lab and center- of- mass angles (in degrees)
for the outgoing particle.
ODP$
THLB-R,THCM-R...denote lab and center- of- mass angles (in degrees)
for the residual nucleus.
ODP$
E(MEV)-O,E(MEV)-R...denote lab energies of the outgoing and residual
particles.
ODP$
V-R...denotes the velocity (in cm/ns) of the residual particle.
ODP$
DWO/DWCM,DWR/DWCM...denotes the ratio of solid angle in the lab
to that in the center- of- mass system for the outgoing and residual
particles.
ODP$
SIGR(MB/STR)CM...denotes the Rutherford cross section (millibarns per
steradian in the center-of-mass system) - calculated for "elastic"
scattering as a function of angle, only.
CEB$
WARNING
BLP$
SIGR(MB/STR)CM is semi-relativistic only and is intended for practical
and not theoretical (purist) use. If you are fussy about it, you
should check to see how it is computed. Also, see 1987 Handbook,
SEC# 520 RUTH.
