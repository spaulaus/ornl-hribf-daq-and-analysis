BANCO  - Copies ban-files to/from Edit Compatible Form
BLP$
ban-files (2-D gate files) were originally implemented on the
HHIRF Perkin-Elmer computer and designed to be created and modified
by means of an interactive graphics program (RIP). ban-file support
routines were designed to read and write such files by means of
direct access. It turns out that files
created by the VAX or UNIX editors can not be accessed directly.
BLP$
Since at some future date I or someone else may wish to produce
VAX or UNIX software which supports interactive graphic creation and
modification of ban-files, I don't want to give up this direct access
file structure.
BLP$
For now you can do the following:
ODP$
(1)....Use the VAX or UNIX editor to create a normal EDIT file (bed-file)
named filnam.bed. Where, filnam denotes any legal filename prefix.
ODP$
(2)....Then use program BANCO to read this bed-file and produce a
directly accessible ban-file (filnam.ban).
ODP$
(3)....You can also use BANCO to translate ban-files to bed-files.

HOW TO CREATE BED FILES
ODP$
(1)....Turn to SEC# 270.20 of the 1987 HHIRF Computer Handbook.
ODP$
(2)....For each 2-D gate (Banana), enter an INP-line, a TIT-line,
a GATE-line and as many CXY-lines as needed. Note that 63 is the
maximum number of X,Y coordinates.
FIP$
Some entries on these lines are not important and were included
in the ban-file for reference only. Let us be thorough and take
it a line at a time.
CYB$
INP FILENAME IH,IB,DG,NP --------------------------------------------------
CYB$
INP
BLP$
Starting in col-1, enter the ASCII characters INP followed by at
least one blank.
CYB$
FILENAME
BLP$
For reference only - but you must enter some ASCII string with no
imbedded blanks. DUMMY is OK.
CYB$
INP FILENAME IH,IB,DG,NP (continued)---------------------------------------
CYB$
IH
BLP$
For reference only - but you must enter some integer. 0 is OK.
CYB$
IB
BLP$
IMPORTANT - This the Banana ID-number. It must be unique for a given
ban-file and may contain no more than 5 digits.
CYB$
DG
BLP$
Do not enter - projection angle for RIP.
CYB$
NP
BLP$
Do not enter - number of X,Y coordinates (will be computed).
CYB$
TIT TITLE -----------------------------------------------------------------
CYB$
TIT
BLP$
Starting in col-1, enter the ASCII characters TIT followed by at
least one blank.
CYB$
TITLE
BLP$
For reference only - enter anything that you wish.
TPF$
SP1$
CYB$
GATE IPX,IPY,LXD,LXG,LYD,LYG,NUPM,IAUX,JAUX -------------------------------
CYB$
GATE
BLP$
Starting in col-1, enter the ASCII characters GATE followed by at
least one blank.
CYB$
IPX
BLP$
For reference only - X-parameter number for histogram from which
gate was defined. You must enter some integer.
CYB$
IPY
BLP$
For reference only - Y-parameter number for histogram from which
gate was defined. You must enter some integer.
CYB$
GATE IPX,IPY,LXD,LXG,LYD,LYG,NUPM,IAUX,JAUX (continued)--------------------
CYB$
LXD
BLP$
For reference only - you may enter the same number as for LXG below.
CYB$
LXG
BLP$
IMPORTANT - specifies the X-dimension of the histogram from which
gate was derived. Used by CHIL in scaling X-test-parameter to match
2-D gate.
CYB$
LYD
BLP$
For reference only - you may enter the same number as for LYG below.
CYB$
LYG
BLP$
IMPORTANT - specifies the Y-dimension of the histogram from which
gate was derived. Used by CHIL in scaling 2-D gate to match
Y-test-parameter.
CYB$
NUPM,IAUX,JAUX
BLP$
Used in pre-CHIL days - no need to enter unless you have a need for
direct processing of ban-files in a USERSUB.
CYB$
CXY X,Y X,Y X,Y .. --------------------------------------------------------
BLP$
Starting in col-1 of each such line, enter the ASCII characters CXY
followed by at least one blank. On the remainder of the line, enter
the X,Y coordinates of the 2-D gate in clockwise order.
BLP$
A given CXY-line must contain an integer number of X,Y pairs.
That is, don't try to split an X,Y pair from one line to the next.
