CHP$LEMOR - Processing of User Defined Files

SEC$.310  Processing of User Defined Files - UDFs
BLP$
Support is provided for the processing of non-scandard event data files.
Such files might be generated via simulations or from some other source.
I will call such files User Defined Files or just \b\UDFs\\. 
BLP$
Please don't confuse this usage of \b\UDF\\ with that refered to in SEC#
320.310 "Creation of DVDs & CDs". I chose the acronym to be similar to \b\LDF\\
without being aware of it's other usage.
CY1$
The commands:
CY1$
\b\UDF filename\\      ;Opens the \b\UDF\\ for sequential access reading
                  ;and sets flags for \b\UDF\\ processing

\b\UDF filename RECL\\ ;Opens the \b\UDF\\ for direct access reading with
                  ;record length = \b\RECL\\
                  ;and sets flags for \b\UDF\\ processing
BLP$
A number of special routines are brought into play. These include:
\b\UDFOPEN, UDFREAD, UDFEVENT & UDFHAN\\
CYB$
This is how it works:
ODP$
o......The \b\UDF\\ command calls \b\UDFOPEN\\ to open the file for input
as indicated above.
ODP$
o......Subsequently, all input requests are executed by \b\UDFREAD\\.
ODP$
o......\b\UDFREAD\\ calls \b\UDFEVENT\\ which actually reads the file and
returns one event per call in the form of INTEGER*4 ID and DATA arrays.
ODP$
o......\b\UDFREAD\\ then builds standard \b\L003\\ data buffers for the calling
subprogram.
ODP$
o......\b\UDFHAN\\ processes the positioning commands \b\REW, FR, & BR\\
which provides for REWIND, BACK-RECORD and FORWARD-RECORD operations.
ODP$
o......\b\UDFEVENT\\  will most certainly need to be customized,
however, it is probably the only one which does.
BLP$
In order to use the \b\UDF\\ support, the user must understand the structure
of the \b\UDF\\ and be able to:
ODP$
o......Modify \b\UDFOPEN\\ to be compatible with the reading requirements,
ODP$
o......Modify \b\UDFEVENT\\ so as to read the \b\UDF\\ and return one
event per call.
CY1$
The source  for default routines are in \b\/tera/milner/DDgnu/Dscanorlib/\\
BLP$
The template (default) \b\UDFEVENT\\ routine is internally documented
and listed on subsequent pages.
