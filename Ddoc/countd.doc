          Two Channel Count-down Single width CAMAC module

Each input has a programmable threshold discriminator.  Threshold
range is 0 to -2.56 volts in -10 mv steps.  The discriminator 0
feeds the count-down circuit and a front panel NIM output.


There are eight divisors for each count-down circuit; 1, 4, 8, 10, 40,
100, 400, and 1000.

CAMAC commands:

F(16)A(0) - Write channel 1 threshold. 8 bit DAC with  -10 mv per bit.
F(16)A(1) - Write channel 1 divisor. 3 bit code.
              0 - divide by 1        5 - divide by 100
              1             4        6             400
              2             8        7             1000
              3            10
              4            40

F(16)A(2) - Write channel 2 threshold
F(16)A(3) - Write channel 2 divisor

F(0)A(0)  - Read channel 1 threshold
F(0)A(1)  - Read channel 1 divisor
F(0)A(2)  - Read channel 2 threshold
F(0)A(3)  - Read channel 2 divisor


Front Panel Inputs:

Channel 1 Discr Input:  Negative linear input.  Disc threshold
                        is 0 to -2.56 volts in -10 mv steps

Channel 2 Discr Input:  Negative linear input.  Disc threshold
                        is 0 to -2.56 volts in -10 mv steps


Front Panel Outputs:

Channel 1 Discr Out:  Fast negative NIM output(16 ma)

Channel 1 Outputs:  3 ea Fast negative NIM outputs(16 ma)


Channel 2 Disc Out:  Fast negative NIM output(16 ma)

Channel 2 Outputs:  3 ea Fast negative NIM outputs(16 ma)
