SEC$.020 Setup
SIN$
BLP$
These codes use \b\/dev/ttyS0\\ on the Linux machine.  The device is
by default owned by root and only user root has 
read/write privileges.
You may want to give all users read/write access.  Otherwise,
you must run these codes as user root.
BLP$
The device ttyS0 is the first serial port on the PC.  The cable connecting
the serial port and the Force processor module must include the RS-232
signals RTS and CTS.  The cable must also be a "null modem".

break         - Send a BREAK to the VME processor
ctrlc         - Send a control C to the VME processor
load filename - Download an S-record file to the VME processor
                Example: load vme3_boot.run loads the boot
                         program to processor vme3
end           - Exit this program

SEC$.030 Differences between VMEterm and VMEconsole
SIN$
BLP$
VMEterm and VMEconsole are functionally equivalent.  The only difference
is in the way the "load" command works.  With VMEterm, characters received
from the VME processor are output to the screen while the file download
is in progress.  VMEconsole delays this output until the file download is
complete.
