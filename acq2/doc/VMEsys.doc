BLP$
SEC$.030 VME Hardware Setup
BLP$
This section covers the installation of the VME front-end system and
its connection the Workstation.
FIP$
1...  Turn off power to the VME crate before inserting or removing
VME modules.
FIP$
2...  Forced air cooling is required for the VME crate.  Some crates
have built-in fan assemblies.  Others require a fan assembly mounted
below the VME crate.
FIP$
3...  In a vertical VME card cage, slot 1 is the leftmost slot when viewing
the front of the crate.  The Force SYS68K CPU processor module
MUST be installed in slot 1.
FIP$
4...  When installing additional modules in the crate, there should
be no empty slots to the left of any module.
BLP$
\B\................ VME Processor Module .................\\
BLP$
There are two hexadecimal switches labeled 1 and 2 on the front panel
of the SYS68K CPU-40 module.  Switch 1 should be set to B and switch
2 should be set to F.
BLP$
There are two hexadecimal switches labeled 1 and 2 on the front panel
of the SYS68K CPU-60 module.  Switch 1 should be set to 7 and switch
2 should be set to F.
BLP$
The setting of these switches control the 
start up of the VME processor.
It is very important these switches be set a described
above!
BLP$
The SYS68K CPU-40/B4 has 4 serial ports.  The 4 9-pin Micro DSUB connectors
labeled 1 thru 4 on the front panel are these serial ports.
Serial ports 3 and 4 are not currently used.
BLP$
The SYS68K CPU-60 has 2 serial ports.  The 2 9-pin DSUB connectors
labeled 1 and 2 on the front panel are these serial ports.
BLP$
Serial port 1 is used by the 
VMEPROM firmware.  Serial port 2 is used if you use the interactive CAMAC
command program VMECNAF.
BLP$
It is not necessary to connect a terminal to any serial port.  If, however,
a terminal is connected, the required terminal setup is:
CYB$
       9600 Baud, 8 bit characters, No parity, and 1 stop bit
BLP$
The VME system must be connected to the Workstation.  You should seek the
help of a network guru.
CYB$
  WARNING:  The SYS68K CPU VME processor module MUST
            be installed in slot 1 of the VME crate.
BLP$
\B\............ KSC 2917 CAMAC Interface Module ...........\\
BLP$
It is recommended that the KSC 2917 module be installed in slot 2 of the
VME crate.  The VME module controls up to 8 KSC 3922 CAMAC crate controllers.
Use of 40 conductor twist-and-flat cable is recommended.  A terminator module
should be connected to the bus output connector at the last KSC 3922.
See the KSC 3922 manual for cabling details.
BLP$
The acquisition system will use a KSC 3982 List Sequencing Crate Controller if
it is installed in slot 23 of CAMAC crate 0.  Installation requires a
40 conductor ribbon cable connecting the KSC 3982 to the KSC 3922 on the rear
of the modules and a LEMO cable from Grant Out on the KSC 3922 to Grant In
on the KSC 3982.  See KSC 3922 and KSC 3982 manuals for more details.
BLP$
\B\........... LRS 1131 FASTBUS Interface Module ..........\\
BLP$
You need this module only if you have a FASTBUS system.  If present, use the
special LeCroy cable to connect the VME module to the LRS 1821 FASTBUS
Segment Manager/Interface.
BLP$
\B\........... CES 8170 High Speed Memory Module ..........\\
BLP$
If you have FERA type readout devices, install a CES 8170 in the VME crate.
The CES 8170 connects to a LRS 4301 FERA Driver CAMAC module.  Three cables
are required.  The data cable is a 34 conductor ribbon.  Use of twist-and-
flat cable is recommended.  Two LEMO cables are required for the data
transfer handshake signals.  Connect WSO on the LRS 4301 to WSI on the
CES 8170.  Also, connect WAO on the CES 8170 to WAI on the LRS 4301.
For instructions on connecting FERA readout devices to the LRS 4301, see the
LRS 4301 manual and manuals for your particular CAMAC modules.
BLP$
\B\........... LRS 1190 VME Dual Port Memory Module .......\\
BLP$
The LRS 1190 is a replacement for the CES 8170. Setup is very similar to
that of the CES 8170.  The data cable is identical to that used with the
CES 8170.  The labeling of the front panel LEMO connectors is different.
The LRS 1190 STROBE input is the same as WSI and the ACK output is the
same as WAO.  You may use upto 5 LRS 1190s in the VME system.  See the
LRS 1190 manual for additional details.
BLP$
\B\................. ORNL Trigger Module ..................\\
BLP$
A VME Event Trigger Module is needed for all setups.  The trigger module
accepts an Event signal, generates a Busy output during readout, and
a Clear signal a the end of readout.  Input and outputs are fast negative
NIM and differential ECL.  See the VME Event Trigger Module document for
additional information.
BLP$
\B\..................... SMOKE TEST ......................\\
BLP$
Now that you have installed all the VME interface modules needed, turn on
power to the VME crate.  Make the sure the fan assembly is also on.
After approx. 45 seconds, VME processor should be ready.  If you have a
terminal attached to serial port 1, you should see a banner similar to
the one below.

SEC$.060 FORTRAN Interface to CAMAC and FASTBUS
BLP$
This section describes FORTRAN callable routines for CAMAC, FASTBUS
hardware I/O and control of the VME acquisition system.  The names and
calling parameters of the CAMAC routines are identical to the Concurrent
system and therefore, very minimal changes are required to
convert a Concurrent program for use with the Workstation/VME system.
BLP$
For new programs, CAMACIO is recommended as a replacement for BHIO.  This
is functionally equivalent but the routine name is a little more
indicative of the function performed.
BLP$
Since the hardware interface to FASTBUS is substantially different
on the Workstation/VME system, Concurrent programs for FASTBUS will
require more changes.
BLP$
Two new routines are available - CAMLIST and FBLIST.  Whereas the basic
routines do one CAMAC or FASTBUS operation per call, these routines
process a list of operations.  This is much more efficient when
large amounts of data must be transferred (i.e. loading pedestal
data to the LRS 1821).
BLP$
Another new routine allows control of the front-end acquisition
system.
BLP$
All routines described in this section are in the library
CY1$
       \b\/usr/acq/vme/vmelib.a\\
BLP$
Any of your FORTRAN programs which have calls to these routines
must be linked with this library.  Of course, any of these routines
may be called by C language programs.
BLP$
\B\...................... CAMAC I/O ......................\\
BLP$
The main CAMAC I/O routines on the Concurrent system were BHIO
and CMCBSC.  These are implemented  here with the same names and
calling parameters. While the syntax for calling these routines
remains the same, the crate number parameter has a different range.
On the Concurrent system the crate number could be 1 thru 63.  On
the Workstation/VME system crate number should be in the range of
0 thru 7.
BLP$
All CAMAC I/O routines return the status of the last operation.
Normally the returned status should be zero.  The error codes
are:
CY1$
      Code         Meaning
        0       Normal return, X = 1 and Q = 1

\B\BHIO ........................Concurrent Compatibility..\\
CY1$
       CALL BHIO(MODE,LU,C,N,A,F,DATA,NUM,STAT)
  where
         MODE  - integer*4, zero means 16-bit CAMAC transfers
                         nonzero means 24-bit CAMAC transfers
         LU    - Not referenced in Workstation/VME version

         NUM   - integer*4, number of CAMAC data transfers
         STAT  - integer*4, returned status of the last CAMAC cycle
BLP$
This routine executes CAMAC cycles to a single CNAF.  If the CAMAC function
code is a read or a write, then NUM data transfers are executed.  If the
value of STAT is nonzero, the routine IPBERR is called to report the
CAMAC error.  There is a default IPBERR routine in the library 
\b\/usr/acq/vme/vmelib.a\\.  The default routine always outputs the message
to the STDERR.  An example error message:
CY1$
CAMAC Error - C,N,A,F =  1  1  0  0  Crate Off_Line
BLP$
If the user has a custom IPBERR routine, it will replace the one in the
library provided the object file containing the routine occurs in the link list
prior to the library.  The file \b\/usr/acq/vme/ipberr.f\\ is an example
of a custom error routine.

         NUM   - integer*4, number of CAMAC data transfers
         STAT  - integer*4, returned status of the last CAMAC cycle
BLP$
This routine is recommended for new programs.  It is functionally
equivalent to BHIO.  The CAMAC error handler routine is CAMERR.
The user may provide a custom error handler by the same name.
The file \b\/usr/acq/vme/camerr.f\\ is an example of a custom
error routine.
BLP$
\B\CAMLIST ...............................................\\
CY1$
       CALL CAMLIST(C,N,A,F,MODE,DATA,NUM,STAT)
  where
         C     - integer*4 array, Crate number, 0 thru 7

         NUM   - integer*4, number of CAMAC operations in list
         STAT  - integer*4 array, returned status of the CAMAC operation
BLP$
All calling parameters, except MODE, are arrays.  Also the status of each
CAMAC cycle is return in the STAT array.
BLP$
\B\..................... FASTBUS I/O .....................\\
BLP$
These routines assume that the FASTBUS system includes a LRS 1131
VME module which connects to a LRS 1821 Segment Manager/Interface.
BLP$
ALL FASTBUS routines return a status which is normally zero.  A nonzero
value indicates an error and the possible error codes are:
CY1$
      Code         Meaning
      '80'X     Timeout
    'c006'X     Illegal register
    'a000'X     Device not available
BLP$
\B\FASTBUSIO .............................................\\
CY1$
       CALL FASTBUSIO(A,RW,DATA,NUM,STAT)
  where
         A     - integer*4, LRS1821 register number
         RW    - integer*4, 0 means read, nonzero means write
         DATA  - integer*2 array
         NUM   - integer*4, number of data transfers
         STAT  - integer*4, returned status
BLP$
This routine accesses a single register in the LRS 1821.  Multiple
data transfers to/from the specified register are allowed.
BLP$
\B\FBLIST ................................................\\
CY1$
       CALL FBLIST(A,RW,DATA,NUM,STAT)
  where
         A     - integer*4 array, LRS1821 register
         RW    - integer*4 array, 0 means read, nonzero means write
         DATA  - integer*2 array
         NUM   - integer*4, number of operations in list
         STAT  - integer*4 array, returned status
BLP$
Typically operations to FASTBUS require a sequence of transfers to/from
multiple registers in the LRS 1821.  All call parameters for this routine
are arrays.  This allows many register transfer operations to sent
to the front-end system in a single ethernet packet.  Use of this function
will significantly reduce the time required to load the pedestal memory.
BLP$
\B\................. ACQUISITION CONTROL ..................\\
BLP$
The VME acquisition system recognizes several commands:
initialize, start, stop, status and zero.  This routine allows a user program
to execute any command and get the status of the VME acquisition system.
BLP$
\B\ACQ_VME_CTRL ...........................................\\
CY1$
       CALL ACQ_VME_CTRL(STAT,COMMAND)
  where
         STAT    - integer*4, returned status
         COMMAND - character*8, Command, MUST be lower case.
                   Recognized Commands are:
                    init
                    start
                    stop
                    status
                    zero
BLP$
The value of STAT depends on the command.  For init, start or stop, a negative
value is an error code and zero means success.  For the status command,
negative is an error code and positive is the encoded status of the VME
acquisition system.
BLP$
The file \b\/usr/acq/vme/acq_vme_ctrl.for\\ assigns mnemonics for the
error codes and acquisition status.  This file may be included in your
FORTRAN code.
BLP$
The routine acq_vme_error may be used to convert an error/status code to
an ASCII string.
CY1$
 
       CALL ACQ_VME_ERROR(ERROR,STRING)
 
  where 
        INT*4  ERROR - Error/status code return by the routine
                       acq_vme_ctrl.
  return 
        CHARACTER*(*)  -  ASCII message for this error code.

SEC$.090 What she'll do
BLP$
Measurements of the event rate and readout time as a function of number of
parameters and parameter type were made.
The event generator was a pulser.  To determine the event rate
, the pulser rate was increased until the front-end system begins losing
events.
The pulser trigged a NIM latch(Joerger Model GG Gate generator) which
was the Event input to the VME system.  When readout completes, the VME system
resets the NIM latch.  The reported readout time is the time the latch
is asserted.
The following table has the rates and readout times for CAMAC and FERA devices.

BLP$
CAMAC readout is presently considerably slower than FERA.  The CAMAC readout
uses different methods depending on the number of parameters read.  If the
number of parameters to be read is 6 or less, readout is strictly programmed
I/O.  For 7 or more parameters, a KSC 3892 List Sequencer is used followed 
by a DMA transfer from the KSC 3982 to the VME system.  The CAMAC readout
times can be approximated as follows:
CY1$
For 6 or fewer parameters:

    readout time (microseconds) = 23 + 10*n

For 7 or more parameters:

    readout time (microseconds) = 54 + 4.4*n

BLP$
FERA read times can be approximated:
CY1$
    readout time (microseconds) = 32 + 2*n
BLP$
The above approximations are valid only if reading a single type of hardware
device.  When readout consists of a both type of devices, some
operations can be done concurrently resulting in a faster readout than predicted
from the above.  The following table shows readout times for varying numbers
of CAMAC and FERA parameters.
