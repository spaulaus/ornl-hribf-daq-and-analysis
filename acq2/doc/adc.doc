HHIRF ADC INTERFACE
.sp 2
.nf
.ul
I  HARDWARE
.sp 1
.fi
The ADC interface consists of a single width CAMAC module and a 5 1/4
inch rack mount chassis.  These are connected via a 40 conductor flat cable
whose length should not exceed 10 meters.
.sp 1
.nf
.ul
I.1  Rack Mount Chassis
.sp 1
.fi
The rack mount chassis holds up to 16 ADC personality cards.  Viewed
from the rear, there are 16 slots numbered 1 thru 16 from left to right.
Personality cards are available for the following ADCs:
.nf
.sp 1
            1) Canberra Model 8060 and Model 8080
            2) Nuclear Data  ND581.
.br
.sp 1
.fi
There are two rows of indicators on the front panel - ADC ENABLED
and ADC ACTIVE.
The ADC ACTIVE is on when the following conditions exist:
.nf
  a) The cable between the rack mount chassis and the CAMAC module
     is installed.
  b) Both the rack mount chassis and the CAMAC crate are powered up.
  c) The ADC is enabled - ADC ENABLE on.
  d) The ADC is performing conversions and presenting data to the
     interface.
.sp 1
.fi
If the conversion rate is greater than 5 per second, ADC ACTIVE will be
on continuously.  Otherwise, it will flash at the conversion rate.
.br
.sp 1
The ADC ABORT input accepts slow NIM or TTL levels.  This signal
is routed to each ADC. Input impedance is > 2K ohms.  Maximum input
voltage is +or- 15 volts.  Minimum pulse width is 250 nanoseconds.
.sp 1
.nf
.ul
I.2  CAMAC module
.sp 1
.fi
The CAMAC module contains a 16 bit data register for each of the
16 possible ADCs.  A 16 bit status register indicates which ADCs have
vaild data available.  The module performs the following functions:
.nf
  a) Read an ADC
  b) Read and Reset an ADC
  c) Read the status register
  d) Enable/Disable ADCs
  e) Enable/Disable LAMs
  f) Test LAM status
  g) Reset ADCs
.sp 1
.fi
Two front panel indicators are provided. N indicates any module access from
the CAMAC dataway.  LAM indicates presence of a LAM in the module.
.sp 1

II  CAMAC Function Codes
.sp 1
.fi
For those commands which reference an ADC using a CAMAC sub-address,
A(0) corresponds to slot 1 and A(15) corresponds to slot 16.  For those
commands which reference an ADC by a data bit, R1 and W1 correspond to
slot 1 and R16 and W16 correspond to slot 16.  R1 and W1 are the least
significant CAMAC read and write lines.
.sp 1
.nf
.ul
II.1 Status Register - F(1)A(12)
.sp 1
.fi
The status register has a bit for each of the 16 possible ADCs.  For
each status bit which is a "one", the corresponding ADC has completed
a conversion and its ADC data register contains the result of the latest
conversion.
.sp 1
.nf
.ul
II.2 ADC Data Registers - F(0)A(y) and F(2)A(y)
.sp 1
.fi
There is a seperate data register for each of the 16 possible ADCs.  If
the corresponding bit is the status register is a "one", Q =1 and the data
are the result of the latest conversion.  If the status register bit is a
"zero", Q =0 and the data are zero.  The Canberra ADCs provide up to 13 data
bits.  The 14th bit of the ADC data register is the INVALID bit from the ADC.
.br
.sp 1
F(0) never resets the status bit nor the ADC.  F(2) resets both the status
bit and the ADC if Q =1.  If Q =0, neither the status bit nor the ADC is
reset.
.sp 1
.nf
.ul
II.3  Enabling and Disabling ADCs - F(17)A(0)
.sp 1
.fi
The data word for this function has a "one" for all ADCs to be enabled
and a "zero" for all ADCs to be disabled.  This command is executed in
two steps.  First, ALL ADCs are disabled, then the selected ones are enabled.
It is essential that ALL ADCs be reset following F(17)A(0).  Use of F(9)A(0)
is recommended.
.sp 1
.nf
.ul
II.4 Reseting ADCs and status bits - F(9)A(0) and F(23)A(0)
.sp 1
.fi
In addition to the read and reset function ( F(2)A(y) ), these
functions reset all ADCs and status bits or selected ones.  F(9)A(0) resets
ALL ADCs and their status bits.  For the function F(23)A(0), the data word
contains a "one" for all ADCs to be reset.
.sp 1
.nf
.ul
II.5 Status testing - F(27)A(15), F(27)A(1) and F(27)A(0)
.sp 1
.fi
These functions test conditions which can cause a LAM, but are independent
of the Enable/Disable for the LAM.
.sp 1
.nf
 F(27)A(15) - Q =1 if no ADC is busy.  For purposes of this test,
              busy is defined as the time interval between the ADC
              going busy and ADC data available in the CAMAC module.
              For this test to be useful, it is essential that all
              disabled ADCs are reset following F(17)A(0).

 F(27)A(0)  - Q =1 if LAM1 status is true.  LAM1 status becomes true
              when all ADCs go not busy.  LAM1 goes false only when
              all ADCs having data available have been reset.

 F(27)A(1)  - Q =1 if LAM2 status is true.  LAM2 status is the OR of
              all bits in the ADC status register and hence will be
              true any time one or more ADCs have data available.
.sp 1
.nf
.ul
II.6   LAM enabling and disabling - F(17)A(13)
.sp 1
.fi
The data word bits W1 and W2 determine the Enable/Disable condition
of LAM1 and LAM2 respectively.  A "one" enables the LAM and a "zero"
disables.  Note: Enabling or disabling the LAMs does not change the LAM
status bits.
.sp 1
.nf
.ul
II.7  C, Z and Inhibit
.sp 1
.nf
   C - Resets all ADCs, all ADC status bits and LAM1 status.  This is
       identical to F(9)A(0).

   Z - In addition to the functions performed by C, LAM1 and LAM2 are
       disabled and all ADCs are disabled.
.sp 1
The module does not use Inhibit in any way.
.sp 1
.nf
.ul
II.8  Hardware test - F(16)A(y)
.sp 1
.fi
This function simulates data transfer from ADCs to the module.
Except for LAM1, all features of the CAMAC module can be verified independent
of the ADCs.  It is recommended, however, that the cable connecting the CAMAC
module and the rack mount chassis be disconnected.

III   Programming considerations
.sp 1
.nf
III.1  Enabling ADCs
.sp 1
.fi
It is recommended that F(17)A(0) be followed by F(9)A(0).
.sp 1
.nf
.ul
III.2  Reading and reseting ADCs
.sp 1
.fi
Each ADC having data available must be reset after reading the data.
F(2) resets the ADC immediately after reading the data.  If F(0) is used to
read the ADC, it must be followed by a reset.
.sp 1
.nf
.ul
III.3  LAM programming
.sp 1
.fi
Two LAM sources are provided.  LAM1 occurs only after all busy ADCs
have finished conversion.  LAM2 occurs whenever any ADC has finished
conversion.
.br
.sp 1
LAM1 is intended for use when two or more ADC are operated in coin-
cidence.  If this is used, the following proceedure is recommended:
.nf
  a) F(1)A(12) - save data for use in reseting the ADCs.
  b) Read those ADCs having data available.
  c) F(23)A(0) with data from step a above.

CAMAC Command Summary
.sp 1
.nf
y = ADC number and is 0 thru 15
CAMAC X=1 for all valid commands.

F(0)A(y)  -  Read ADC(y).  Q=1 if ADC(y) status bit = 1.  If Q=0,
             then ADC data are zero. Does not reset ADC(y) nor ADC(y)
             status bit.

F(1)A(12) -  Read ADC status register.  One bit for each of 16 ADCs.
             If the status bit for ADC(y) = 1, then ADC(y) has completed
             a conversion cycle and ADC(y) data is available.

F(2)A(y)  -  Read and Clear ADC(y).  Q=1 if ADC(y) status bit = 1.
             If Q=0, then ADC(y) data are zero.  Resets ADC(y) and
             ADC(y) status bit only if Q=1.

F(9)A(0)  -  Reset all ADCs, reset the ADC status register, and clear LAM1.

F(16)A(y) -  Writes ADC(y) data register from CAMAC dataway and sets
             ADC(y) status bit.  Hardware test purposes only. NOTE: Q=0.

F(17)A(0) -  Write ADC enable register.  One bit for each of 16 ADCs.

F(17)A(13)-  Write LAM mask register.  Two LAMs are provided.  LAM1 is
             generated when all enabled ADCs have finished conversion
             and data are valid.  LAM2 is generated when any ADC data
             is ready.  LAM1 is cleared by reseting all ready ADCs.
             LAM2 will be asserted any time it is enabled and the ADC
             status register is not zero.

F(23)A(0) -  Selectively reset ADCs and their status bits.

F(27)A(0) -  Test for LAM1 status.  Tests the condition which would
             generate LAM1.  Test is independent of the Enable/Disable
             condition of LAM1.

F(27)A(1) -  Test for LAM2 status (i.e. ADC status register not zero).
             Test is independent of the Enable/Disable condition of LAM2.

F(27)A(15)-  Test for all enabled ADCs not Busy.  Either all ADCs have
             completed conversion and data are available or no conversion
             has been initiated for any enabled ADC.

Z.S2      -  Disables LAMs, disable all ADCs, reset all ADCs, reset ADC
             status register, and clear LAM1.

C.S2      -  Reset all ADCs, reset the ADC status register, and clear LAM1.


INHIBIT   -  Module does not use INHIBIT in any way.
