120  12  How to Copy CAMAC Scalers to Tape

SEC$.010  Introduction
BLP$
\b\scad is New & Improved\\ - it now provides for graphical rate displays
(like \b\scudd\\) in addition to the standard tabular displays of earlier
\b\scad\\ versions. 
It also provides for printing scaler tables on a
printer of your choice and simultaneously copying same to a 
"snap file" (see SEC# 030).
BLP$
The tabular display is defined by 
one "scaler initialization" (\b\snit\\) file (you are prompted for
this one when \b\scad\\ is first started). This is the only opportunity that
you have to specify this file.
BLP$
Graphical rate  displays are defined by another \b\snit\\ file which
is specified by the command:
CYB$
gnit filename
BLP$
This file can be the same
as the file for tabular displays if the number of scalers are no more than 8.
This file may be redefined at any time or the graphic display eliminated by
the command:
CYB$
clrg
CEN$
\bu\How to Get Started\\
CY1$
Make a \b\snit\\-file for the tabular display \b\(required)\\

Make a \b\snit\\-file for any graphic display \b\(optional) (max# = 8)\\

Type: \b\setenv VME vmex\\   ;where vmex denotes the name of the vme
                        ;processor that you are using - vme1, vme2..

Type: \b\/usr/hhirf/scad\\   ;To start program
                        ;Enter tabular \b\snit\\ file name as directed
                        ;Then enter commands from following lists

SEC$.020  Main Features
ODP$
o......Supports "live" display of \b\raw\\ and \b\computed\\
(linear combinations of hardware readings and/or computed
values) scaler information.
ODP$
o......Supports scaler logging to file \b\scad.log\\ via the
command \b\log\\ or via auto-logging (see LSEC command SEC# 30).

SEC$.050  Tabular Display - Discussion of Audio Alarms - BONGO
CY1$
\bu\This is what scad does\\
ODP$
o......When scad is started, it opens or creates a file \b\scadalarm.dat\\ in
the directory in which scad is running.
ODP$
o......If one or more limits are defined and violated, scad writes the epoch
time (# seconds since Jan 1,1970) into record 1 of that file.
ODP$
o......This occurs every 5 seconds as long as a limit is being violated.
CY1$
\bu\This is how BONGO works\\
ODP$
o......You must open a window on some LINUX CPU console that is nearby so
that you can hear it's speakers.
ODP$
o......Set the directory to same as that where scad is running and type:
CYB$
/usr/hhirf/bongo
ODP$
o......BONGO is a looping script which runs programs to read scadalarm.dat
every 5 seconds to see if the time written there is within 10 seconds of the
current epoch time.
ODP$
o......If it is, then a \b\play\\ process is executed which sounds a loud BONG!
ODP$
o......This BONG sound is repeated every 5 seconds until
no limit is being violated or
the associated scad is halted via CTRL-C or terminated.
The BONGing can be suspended by interrupting scad and typing:
CYB$
hush MIN 
FIP$
Where MIN is the number of minutes to SHUT UP. This lets you continue 
running scad without having to hear all of that BONGing!
CEB$
Well, this is how it is supposed to work!
but
The last upgrade to Redhat-10 seems to have broken the play function!
So I guess we'll have to see if it can be fixed by the experts!
TPF$
SP1$
SEC$.060  Graphic Display - Introduction
BLP$
scad also provides for a graphic display of a limited number of scaler
rates. Features are listed below:
ODP$
o......Up to 8 scalers to be graphically displayed may be defined via
a standard \b\snit\\ file using the \b\gnit\\ command (see SEC# 070).
ODP$
o......The count rate in counts/sec (based on the computer's internal
clock) is displayed in the form of software generated "meters".
ODP$
o......Displays may be either linear or log (all displays will be of the
same type).
ODP$
o......\u\For log display\\, The display range is 1 to 20 with a power-of-10
scale factor (shown in the window banner). The scale factor is automatically
changed when the count rate falls outside the current range.
ODP$
o......\u\For linear display\\, the display range is 0 to 12 with a power-of-10
scale factor (shown in the window banner).
The scale factor is automatically changed when the count rate exceeds the
current high limit or falls below 0.8 times the current scale factor.

\b\Note:\\ Rate limits have been defined by the \b\GLIM\\ command as indicated.
See the next page for command syntax which is \b\(glim name lo hi)\\.
BLP$
\b\Note:\\ The inside pointer indicates the power-of-10 scale factor and is
the same as that given in the banner.
BLP$
Limits specified via the \b\glim\\ command specify "rate values" for which
a "visual alarm" will be displayed. 
CY1$
IF(rate.GT.hi) - Displays flashing yellow disks at upper left & right
IF(rate.LT.lo) - Displays flashing white  disks at lower left & right
BLP$
The number at the bottom of each display gives the rate averaged over a
greater time than that of the meter (so you can read it). This fact leads 
to some disagreement between the two when rates change rapidly which was
the case here.

SEC$.090  Preparation of Initialization (snit) files
BLP$
Use the editor to prepare a scaler initialization file (snit file
- the filename extension is usually .sca).
The snit file is divided into two sections. First the
hardware scalers to be read are specified, followed by definitions of
any computed scalers. The general form of the snit file is shown
below:
CY1$
----------------------------------------------------------------------
LABEL C N A 
  .
LABEL C N A       ;NOR NORF (normalize all rates to this scaler)
  .
LABEL C N A ECL   ;NOD
  .
LABEL C N A ECL
  .
LABEL SIS3820 N A
  .
$END                          (flags the end of scalers to be read)
LABEL : EXPRESSION ...        (computed scaler - no display)
&       EXPRESSION-continued  (up to 20 lines per definition)
LABEL = EXPRESSION            (computed scaler - to be displayed)
                              (see SEC# 350.170 for EXPRESSION info)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ODP$
LABEL..denotes a unique label (11 characters max) which must contain
no imbedded blanks or the characters + - / *
ODP$
C......denotes the scaler module crate number.
ODP$
N......denotes the scaler module slot number.
ODP$
A......denotes the scaler sub-address (numbers start at 0).
ODP$
ECL....denotes an ECL-scaler (requires special read/clear functions).
ODP$
NOD....specifies no LIVE display when using program scad.
ODP$
NOR....specifies that all rates (counts accumulated during the display
interval) are to be normalized to this scaler.
CY1$
NORF...specifies a rate normalization factor which is used as follows:

       Rate = NORF*Count-Increment/(Normalizing Scaler Increment)

SIS3820 ...specifies a SIS model 3820 VME scaler module. N is scaler

           module number and A is the channel number.  Currently we

           have only one of these modules, so N must be 1.  A must

           be 0 thru 31 ( 32 channels ).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
TPF$
CY1$
\bu\Discussion of Computed Scaler Expressions\\
CY1$
All expressions are of the form:  OP LABEL OP LABEL OP LABEL ...
BLP$
Where, OP denotes an operator (+ - / *) and LABEL denotes any
previously defined label. If the OP-field is omitted, + is
assumed. All expressions are evaluated LEFT-TO-RIGHT. Due to
the limited expression syntax, you will probably need to define
intermediate LABELs which you do not wish to display. This is
accomplished by using a : instead of an = in the label definition, as
illustrated above.

SP1$
SEC$.120  How to Copy CAMAC Scalers to Tape
BLP$
CAMAC scalers may be read and written to the data acquisition output
tape during the acquisition process. The following features are
supported:
ODP$
(1)....Scalers to be read are specified in exactly the same way as described
for program \b\scad\\ (i.e. for real time display). 
See SEC# 090 and 100.
ODP$
(2)....Scaler records may be written to tape at timed intervals
(10 to 1000 seconds are allowed), preceding
file-marks or both.
ODP$
(3)....Scalers may be cleared after each reading if desired.
ODP$
(4)....The date & time of recording, recording time interval, 
and clear-flag are included in each record.
ODP$
(5)....Scaler records are 32000 bytes long and written in ASCII. If we 
assume an I*4 array SCAL(10,800), then:
CYB$
       (SCAL(I,1),I=1,10) - Contains 'SCALER DUMP' 
       (SCAL(I,2),I=1,10) - Contains Date & Time, Time-interval, Clear-flag
       (SCAL(I,N),I=1,10) - Contains Label, Count, Rate   
                            FORMAT   3A4,   I12,   1PE12.3, 4X
       Unused portions of the 32000-byte record are blank-filled.
ODP$
(6)....Program \b\lemor\\ supports the retrieval, display and logging of these
records. While running \b\lemor\\, Type: H LIST, for relevant commands.
ODP$
(7)....The maximum number of scalers supported at this time
(raw plus computed) is 790.
