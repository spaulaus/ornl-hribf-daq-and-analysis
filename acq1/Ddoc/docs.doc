Some of you may know that there are documents available for almost all of the
acquisition and data analysis codes.  There are notebooks containing
many of the available documents in the RMS and DRS counting rooms.  In addition,
some have personal notebooks which have been distributed to interested users
over the years.  But NOW

Most documents are available \b\online\\, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  No
longer must you share dog-eared copies with colleagues.  You may print or
view on-screen the very latest version of the document of your choice.
BLP$
There are two easy ways to access online documents: \b\dodoc\\ and
\b\viewdoc\\.  To use \b\viewdoc\\, your \b\PATH\\ must include
\b\/usr/local/bin\\.
ODP$
1) ...  \b\dodoc\\ - Print entire documents on the printer of your choice.
To get a list of the available documents, just type \b\dodoc\\.  Some examples
of using dodoc to print the document \b\damm\\ follow:
CY1$
          \b\dodoc damm\\            ;Print using the default Postscript printer

          \b\dodoc damm ps04\\       ;Print using printer ps04

          \b\dodoc damm double\\     ;Print two-sided using ps01 in Rm T-210

ODP$
2) ...  \b\viewdoc\\ - View the document on-screen.  Alphas use the code
\b\gv\\.  DECStations use the code \b\ghostview\\.  To get a list of the
available documents, just type \b\viewdoc\\.  With viewdoc you can select
pages to print or print the entire document.  For example, to view the
document for \b\damm\\, type
CY1$
          \b\viewdoc damm\\

Well, we gave it our best shot but as the old saying goes: You can lead a 
horse to water but you can't make him drink.
