SEC$.070 Introduction
SIN$
BLP$
Many of the CAMAC modules used in data acquisition require some initialization.
Examples of parameters which must be initialized include thresholds, pedestals,
enables and modes.  There are several ways to do the initialization:
INP$
1)..  The $ini statement in your \b\pac\\ file.  This is probably the best
way if you have simple modules and a small number of then.  Note that
the $ini commands are executed each time you do \b\initvme\\.
INP$
2)..  User written codes.  As with using $ini, the users must understand
the operation of the module in detail.  Several experimenters have written
such codes.  The user should do \b\initvme\\ after executing their code.
INP$
3)..  The program modu_setup provides another method.  The user provides
a data file which specifies the module type, hardware location and
parameter data.  The code handles the details of initializing the
modules.  The user need only understand the functional operation of each
module.  The user should do \b\initvme\\ after executing modu_setup.
BLP$
The program is in directory \b\/usr/acq/vme\\.
BLP$
SEC$.020 Data file syntax
BLP$
The data file for \b\modu_setup\\ has only one format restriction.  The module
type MUST be the first fields on a line.  Blank lines are allowed.  Comment
fields begin with \b\* \\or \b\; \\ and extend to the end of the current
line.  The input is case insensitive.   An \b\= \\ may be used to separate
data fields.
BLP$
The module type is specified in the field following the keyword \b\mt\\.
Again,
\b\mt\\ MUST be the first field on a line.  The following fields must have
at least the CAMAC crate number and the slot or slots where this type module
is installed.  Any parameters not specified will either be disabled or 
initalized to their default values.  See the individual module descriptions
for the default values.  Data parameters may be in any order. 
Everything following the \b\mt\\ applies to the specified module type at the
specified hardware locations until a new \b\mt\\ statement is found
or the end-of-file is detected.  Examples of module type specifications:
CY1$
        mt  phil_7164
        mt=silena_4418
BLP$
The following is a list of module types which modu_setup knows how to
initialize.  The module type may abbreviated as long as it remains unique.
CY1$
        hhirf_adc      lrs_4415a      phil_7164      silena_4418
        lrs_3351       lrs_4416b      phil_7166      ue_clock
        lrs_3511       lrs_4418       phil_7167      lrs_3377
        lrs_4300       lrs_4508       phil_7186      caen_775
        lrs_4413       phil_7106      phil_7187      caen_785
BLP$
The hardware location of the CAMAC module or modules must be specified.
You must specify the CAMAC crate number and the slot(s) in the crate.
Crate and slot numbers MUST be decimal.  The following are all equivalent:
CY1$
        crate 1  slot 22
        crate=1  slot= 22
        c=1  n=22
        c=1  slot 22
BLP$
Multiple modules may be initialized identically.  For example, the
specification
CY1$
        n=2-5
BLP$
means initialize modules 2, 3, 4 and 5.  The same data is used for all
4 modules.
BLP$
VME modules are identified by internal switch settings. There are ten
ADCs numbered 1 thru 10.  There are ten TDCs numbered 1 thru 10.  Which
modules are installed in your VME crate can be determined by running
\b\vmehardware\\.  In the ideal world, front panel labels would
identify which module is which.  The user must specify which module(s)
are to be initialized as follows:
CY1$
        adc=3
        tdc=5
BLP$
Multiple modules may be initialized identically.  For example, the 
specification
CY1$
        adc=3-5
BLP$
means initialize ADC modules 3, 4 and 5.  The same data is used for all
3 modules.
BLP$
The fields following the keyword \b\data\\ specify the data type(s) and
the data.  Known data types are:
CY1$
        anticoinc           enables           offset_memory
        bgo_only            ge_only           overflow
        common_threshold    lower_threshold   pedestals
        conversion_gain     mode              upper_threshold
        delays              maximum_time
BLP$
The data types may be abbreviated as long as they remain unique.  Multiple
data types may be specified prior to the actual data.  The number of 
datum required for a given type is module dependent.  For example, if the
module has sixteen channels and has a pedestal data type, sixteen pedestal
values MUST be specified.  Numeric data may decimal or hexadecimal.  There
are two formats for hexadecimal data:  \b\0f07h\\ and \b\0xf07\\ are
equivalent and are same as 3841 decimal.
BLP$
SEC$.030  Initialization by VME acquisition system
BLP$
Several of the modules we use have multiple readout modes.  Modules may
have one or more of the following modes:
ODP$
1)...  Random access.  Channel determined by the CAMAC subaddress - A
ODP$
2)...  Compressed CAMAC.  Only channels having valid data are read.
ODP$
3)...  Compressed front panel FERA readout.
BLP$
The readout mode is determined by your \b\pac\\ program.  The default
mode is random access.  If you add an \b\mt=\\ field to your \b\$cam\\
statement, you are specifying that the compressed CAMAC mode be used.
A \b\$fer\\ statement in your \b\pac\\ specifies front panel FERA readout.
BLP$
By default \b\modu_setup\\ sets the mode to random access.  When you run
\b\initvme\\, the VME acquisition system may change the mode to either
compressed CAMAC or front panel FERA depending on your \b\pac\\
program.
BLP$
The VME acquisition changes only the mode register bits which have to do
with the readout mode.  Other mode register bits may be set using
\b\modu_setup\\.  See the specific module for details.
BLP$
SEC$.040 HHIRF ADC Interface
BLP$
The HHIRF_ADC interface is a CAMAC readout for Nuclear Data and
Canberra NIM spectroscopy grade ADCs.  Up to 16 ADCs are multiplexed
into a singe CAMAC module.  ADCs must be enabled on a channel by channel
basis.
CY1$
      Data Type     Number     Range

    enable            16       0 or 1

BLP$
If no enable data are specified, the default is to disable all
channels.
CY1$
           Default Setup

        enable            0
BLP$
An example for the hhirf_adc follows:
CY1$
mt=hhirf_adc crate=6 slot=1
*
*   Enable the first eight channels
*
data=enable 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
BLP$
SEC$.050 LRS 3511  Spectroscopy ADC
BLP$
Two parameters may be set by the user: conversion_gain and offset.  The
conversion gain can range from 250 channels full scale to 8000 channels.
One should pick a value from the list below.  The offset is not very
useful in our case but is included for completeness.  The ADC data is
ORed with the offset to form the output data word.  Hence, the minimum
value for the offset should be next power of 2 greater than the 
conversion gain.  For example, if you set the conversion gain to 500,
the minimum offset should be 512.
CY1$
      Data Type     Number      Values

    conversion_gain    1    250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 or 8000
    offset             1    256 to 32768

BLP$
If one or more parameters are not specified, the defaults
are:
CY1$
           Default Setup

        conversion_gain   8000
        offset            0
BLP$
Example specification for the LRS_3511:
CY1$
mt=lrs_3511 c=6 n=23
 data = conversion 250
 data = offset 0
BLP$
SEC$.060 LRS 4300  16-Channel Fast Encoding and Readout ADC
BLP$
Normally the user should specify only the pedestal and overflow
data types.  The default readout mode is random access.  The VME acquisition
system will change the mode if your \b\pac\\ program specifies compressed
CAMAC or front panel FERA readout.
BLP$
If you do not specify pedestal data, pedestal subtraction will be
disabled.
CY1$
     \b\WARNING:\\  You must do \b\initvme\\ after modu_setup to
               ensure proper readout.
CY1$
      Data Type     Number    Units         Range

SEC$.070 LRS 4413  16-Channel Discriminator
BLP$
You can enable/disable each channel.  There is a common threshold for
all channels in the module.  The common threshold may be controlled by
a front panel screwdriver adjustment or programmed.
CY1$
      Data Type     Number    Units         Range

BLP$
You can enable/disable each channel.  There is a common threshold for
all channels in the module.  The common threshold is controlled by a
front panel screwdriver adjustment.
BLP$
In \b\normal\\ mode, channels are independent except for the common 
threshold.  In \b\test\\ mode, a fast negative NIM signal at the
test input generates an output for each enabled channel.
BLP$
You may specify the mode as 0 or 1 where 0 means normal mode. Alternately,
you may specify the mode as normal or test.

\b\BEWARE:\\ There are three versions of these modules.  All modules allow
16 delay settings.  The Model 4418(4518) with no suffix provides 1 nanosecond
steps for a maximum delay of 16 nanoseconds.  The Model 4418/100(4518/100)
has steps of 2 nanoseconds with a maximum delay of 32 nanoseconds. The
Model 4418/300(4518/300) has 16 nanosecond steps and a maximum delay of
128 nanoseconds.
BLP$
This setup assumes that you have a Model 4418/300(4518/300) module.  For this
module you select the desired delay in nanoseconds.  If you have a

The readout is always the double word format.  This provides 0.5 nanosecond
resolution over the full time range.  Only rising edges of inputs are
recorded.
BLP$
The Measure Pause Interval is always set to zero.  In the common stop mode,
there are rear panel trigger outputs available.  The trigger pulse delay
is zero and trigger pulse output width is 50 nanoseconds.

SEC$.170 CAEN V775 32-Channel TDC
BLP$
The user sets the low_threshold in channels from 0 to 2047.  The 
hardware thresholds are in multiples of 16 channels.  The user specified
threshold is converted to the nearest multiple of 16. 
BLP$
The TDC can be operated in Common Start or Common Stop mode.  The
maximum_time (full scale time) may be set from 140 nanoseconds to
1200 nanoseconds.
