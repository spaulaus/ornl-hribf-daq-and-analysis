SEC$200  How to Copy CAMAC Scalers to Tape
BLP$
CAMAC scalers may be read and written to the data acquisition output
tape during the data acquisition process. The following features are
supported:
ODP$
(1)....Scalers to be read are specified in exactly the same way as described
for program SCAD (i.e. for real time display). See the SCAD section of the 
ORPHAS manual.
ODP$
(2)....Scaler records may be written to tape at timed intervals
(10 to 1000 seconds are allowed), preceeding
file-marks or both.
ODP$
(3)....Scalers may be cleared after each reading if desired.
ODP$
(4)....The date and time of the scaler record dump is included in the 
record.
ODP$
(5)....Scaler records are 32000 bytes long and written in ASCII.
ODP$
(6)....Program \b\lemo\\ supports the retrival, display and logging of these
records. While running \b\lemo\\, Type: H LIST, to see relevant commands.
ODP$
(7)....The maximum number of scalers supported at this time
(raw plus computed) is 790.
